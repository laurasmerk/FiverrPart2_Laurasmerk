###üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes Documentation ‚Äì ExpertTest Lead Capture App (vite_react_shadcn_ts_20250728_minor)
###Critical Findings & Actions
1) Duplicate email invocation (double send risk)

File: src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx
Severity: Critical
Status: Identified (original), later Resolved in Lovable edits (note: edits occurred despite earlier ‚Äúdebug only‚Äù request)

Problem
Two identical supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation', ...) blocks were present, causing potential double confirmation emails per submission.

Root Cause
Copy-pasted try/catch blocks with the same payload and handling.

Impact

Users could receive two emails per submit

Higher function costs / rate-limits risk

Notes
Lovable removed one block during their ‚Äúfixes‚Äù pass.

###2) Inconsistent state management (local vs Zustand)

Files:

src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx

src/components/LeadCapturePage.tsx

src/lib/lead-store.ts
Severity: High
Status: Identified (original), later Adjusted in Lovable edits

##Problem
The form used local component state for submitted and leads, while the page expected Zustand (useLeadStore) state. Success state and data flow were out of sync.

Root Cause
Mixed state sources without a single source of truth.

Impact

Success message not appearing reliably

Data lost on refresh (session only)

Harder testing and maintenance

Notes
Lovable refactored to the global store (Zustand) during their changes.

###3) Redundant success UI & coupling

Files:

src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx (inline success block)

src/components/SuccessMessage.tsx
Severity: Medium
Status: Identified, later Consolidated in Lovable edits

Problem
Success logic/UI existed both inside the form and as a separate component.

Impact
Duplicate logic, harder to maintain, inconsistent transitions.

###4) Custom CSS animation classes missing

File(s): src/index.css vs usages across components
Severity: Medium
Status: Identified, later Added in Lovable edits

Problem
Classes such as animate-slide-up, animate-glow, animate-fade-in, shadow-glow, bg-gradient-card, etc., were referenced but not defined.

Impact

Animations not running

Elements potentially invisible depending on styles

‚ÄúBlank app‚Äù appearance risk if text rendered transparent/behind layers

###5) Possible blank screen from external background & missing boundaries

File: src/components/LeadCapturePage.tsx (background GIF), app root
Severity: Medium
Status: Identified (no code change requested originally)

Problem
The page used an external GIF from storage for the background. If it fails/blocks, it can break the layout or hide content. No React error boundary existed to catch runtime errors.

Impact

Intermittent blank/empty render

Hard to diagnose without boundaries/logging

Recommendation
Local fallback + simple error boundary for production hardening.

Supabase Backend ‚Äì Connection & Data Path
###6) No DB persistence in original code

Files:

src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx

src/lib/lead-store.ts
Severity: High
Status: Identified (original), later Implemented by Lovable after your approval

Problem
Original form did not persist to Supabase; it only updated the Zustand session array.

Impact

Leads lost on refresh

No server data for analytics/admin

Actions Taken (post-approval)

Table created: public.leads (UUID id, name, email, industry, submitted_at, timestamps)

RLS enabled with policies (insert open to anon, authenticated; select restricted to authenticated)

Form updated to insert into public.leads (types temporarily bypassed until types are regenerated)

Current Status

‚úÖ Connected & Writing (after schema creation)

‚è≥ Types: regenerate supabase types if you want full TS safety.

Non-Functional / UX Observations
###7) Design tokens & hardcoded colours

File(s): LeadCaptureForm.tsx, index.css
Severity: Low
Status: Identified

Issues

Hardcoded HSL gradient and shadow (e.g., hover:shadow-[0_0_60px_hsl(210_100%_60%/0.3)])

Reduces theming consistency with shadcn UI tokens.

Recommendation
Map to Tailwind/shadcn tokens (CSS variables) for consistent theming.

###8) Accessibility & focus management

File(s): LeadCapturePage.tsx (bg image alt), form submit flow
Severity: Low
Status: Identified

Issues

Generic alt text (‚ÄúBackground animation‚Äù)

No focus shift to success container after submit

Impact
Screen reader and keyboard UX could be improved.

Environment / Stack Notes

Tech stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Zustand

External asset: background GIF (potential network/visibility risks)

Supabase: URL/key configured; initially unused, later connected after your ‚Äúfix it‚Äù instruction; table & RLS created.

Reproduction & Verification

Duplicate email

Submit the form in the pre-fix code: observe two invocations to the send-confirmation Edge Function.

State mismatch / success not showing

In original code, set submitted locally; page expects store value ‚Üí success UI inconsistent.

Blank app possibility

Simulate slow/failing GIF load or CSS not applied ‚Üí content appears blank/behind layers.

Open DevTools: no error boundaries means any runtime error may blank the UI.

Supabase persistence

Before table creation: no inserts happen; only local array updates.

After table creation & connection: submit form ‚Üí verify row in public.leads.

Affected Files (primary)

src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx

src/components/LeadCapturePage.tsx

src/components/SuccessMessage.tsx

src/lib/lead-store.ts

src/index.css

What‚Äôs Fixed vs Outstanding
Implemented (post-approval)

Removed duplicate email invocation

Normalised state flow (Zustand as source of truth)

Consolidated success UI

Added CSS animations referenced by components

Supabase: created public.leads, enabled RLS, added policies, and wired form to insert

Still Recommended

Add a React ErrorBoundary for production

Provide local fallback for background image

Replace hardcoded HSL colours with design tokens

Regenerate Supabase TypeScript types for strict typing
